# Browser Extension Manager UI

This project is a responsive and interactive **Browser Extension Manager UI** built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
It is based on a Frontend Mentor challenge and focuses on dynamic data handling, UI state management, filtering, and theming.

The goal of this project was to closely match the provided design while building a clean, accessible, and responsive interface.
